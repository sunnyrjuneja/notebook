This is the first post of my blog. I'll be writing about startups, programming,
and occasionally topics of personal interest.

The core technology that powers this blog is [Jekyll][jekyll] and
[Amazon S3][s3]. Eventually, I'll do an in-depth write up about how it all works
For now, you can read [this post by Stammy][stammy]. It's fairly similar.

[jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com/
[s3]: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/
[stammy]: http://paulstamatiou.com/hosting-on-amazon-s3-with-cloudfront/

The code for this blog is available on [GitHub][notebook].
