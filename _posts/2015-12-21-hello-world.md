This is the first post of my blog. I'll be writing about startups, programming,
and occasionally topics of personal interest.

The core technology that powers this blog is [Jekyll][jekyll] and
[Amazon S3][s3]. Eventually, I'll do an in-depth write up about how it all works
For now, you can read [this post by Stammy][stammy]. It's fairly similar.

The code for this blog is available on [GitHub][notebook].

For other inquiries, feel free to tweet me at [@SunnyRJuneja][twitter] or email
me at <a href="mailto:jr.sunny@gmail.com">jr.sunny@gmail.com</a>.

Ciao.
