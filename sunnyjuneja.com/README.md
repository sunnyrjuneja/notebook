# sunnyjuneja.com

This is the code required to generate sunnyjuneja.com. In order to get this
running, you'll at minimum need an installation of Ruby (>= 2.2.0) and the gem
Jekyll (>= 3.0.0).

## Forking this blog

Like what I did? Thanks! If you (or myself) need to rebuild a jekyll blog
quickly:

* `git clone https://github.com/sunnyrjuneja/notebook.git`
* `cd notebook`
* `rm -r _posts/* _pages/* _static/*`
* That should have removed any of my personal content. Now you'll want to modify
`_config.yml`.

Please keep in mind that I worked very hard to create the content on this
blog. You're not permitted to redistribute my design, pages, posts or static
files without my explicit permission. I've open sourced to make it easy for
someone start their own blog or learn how this blog works. If I find others
ripping off my content, I will have to make this repository private.
