# Open Questions
How will self driving cars change the assumptions made in this book?
If there is a break through in nuclear fission (or other energy resources), is there still a need for sustainability?

"It has been said that if you wish to look far into the future, then you should first look far back in time."

industralized socities: buildings and transport of people and goods account for 70% of total energy expended
urbanization offers economies of scale

usa data: economic growth & job creation are stronger in cities, poverty rising faster in suburbs
higher gas prices, foreclosure rates in suburban

# Chap1: A County of Countries: Of Highways, Houses and Hedges
Land development has quadrupled since 1945, 2x the rate of population growth
11m americans hold mortgages with greater values than their homes

Big Idea: 
Our most urgent problems (may they be economic, socioeconomic, public health, environmental problem) are all exacerbated or driven by how we live. Policies at all levels of gov (federal, state, municipal) drive suburbanization.

"City": place that can provide significant ridership for mass transit such as a subway network (30 =< housing units per acre) [an acre is about the size of a football field].
City <-> Hyperdensity (used interchangably)
transit based criteria essential since big cities (vs real) create slightly more compact places where driving is still essential
book contrasts itself against other urban literature by using transit based density instead of any other density measure
results in a city which is neither walkable nor drivable

Big Idea:
Suburbanization Driven by a set of political and historical circumstances

1934: FDR new deal policy of National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Admistration and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Coproration to stem the tide of foreclosures resulting from the great depression and to make housing and mortgages more affordable. More people could afford down payments and interest on mortgages and the market for SFhs became much larger.

1940s: National City Lines Cartel (General Motors, Firestone and Standard Oil)
elimination of electric streetcar routes across the country

Post WW2:  Federal Highway Act of 1956 and intense lobbying by NAR further enabled home ownership through expansion of roadways into, out of and between cities resulting in impossible level of suburban development.

1950s-1970s: Recession, racial tension and fear of nuclear war lead to the dispersement of population from cities to suburbs. Cities collected less taxes which lead to smaller municipal budgets, high debt, and increased crime. In general, this became a time of high anti-urban sentiment.

2012 WSJ : Cities are growing faster than their urban counter parts
2013 MNSBC: Economy slump (temp), inability of young people to afford downpayments (temp), and a preference for places that do not require driving everywhere (perm).

Required to encourage urbanization (and not suburbanization):
* Phasing out federal home mortgage interest deduction (MID)
* ceasing the backing by fannie mae and freddie mac of larger mortgages
* removing subsidies for the oil industry
* reclassifying SUVs and minivans as light trucks
* Allocating federal transportation dollars by population
* distributing those dollars fairly across all modes of transportation, rail, mass transit, insead of disporportionately funding highways and runways
* streamlining the national environmental protection act (NEPA) to reduce the redtape associated with urban development and building large scale infastructure
* pricing fuel to reflect negative externalities (pollution and congestion)

pg 40 Bob the Builder analogy

If all seven billion lived at the density of townhouses instead of single-family homes, but nowhere close to the density of big American cities, the entire planet would fit in the state of texas surrounded by nothing but nature and agriculture. visualization on pg 48

pg 44-45 how homes have increased in size but decreased in family size
housing units out paced population

Humans directly influence 83% of the Earths land area.

# Chap2: Cities, Prosperity, and Globalization

theory of import replacement (jane jacobs): all cities imported goods and services but over time came to manufacture these goods and services internally thus replacing import reliance with internal economic growth. Once a city coould produce these goods/services, it would export to them to other cities which would eventually produce them goods/services themselves.

pg 56 2012 US Conference of Mayors: 3% of the nations land mass generates 85% of its GDP.

creative-capital theory: (richard florida) subset of highly skilled professionals who drive creative industries not only earn more and contribute to economic growth but also can have a significant impact on reversing the decline of once prominent cities by reinvigorating their urban cores, attracting both investment and development funds "that patent intensity--the per capita invention rate--is positively related to the density of employment in the highly urbanized portion of [metropolitan areas]". research shows that when urban density doubles, productivity increases in a range between 6-28%.

cities must grow tlaent by having numerous great schools (Boston), by attracting talent with superior amenities (Portland, Oregon), or offering soem mixture of affordability, good education and livability (Austin)

cities can not grow due to limited supply of spaces for people and business to inhabit from a combination of over-regulating new development and poor utilization of existing urban building stock (preservation of industrial neighborhoods, retail, and tourist destinations)

pg 58 how much bigger is Chicago relative to other economies

"while it is conventional among academics and journalists to point out that the world's population is urbanizing, data suggests the world is primarily suburbanizing. other nations are, to their and world's deteriment, adopting the inefficient and unsustainable development model for which America...Housing, feeding and transporting the world's growing populatin will deplete and destroy the earth's resources if everyone adopts the same inefficient, unhealty and unsustainable living habits."

Although building cities and the infastructure to support them has high capital coss, cities provide a much higher level of demand in the labor market and a more varied array of options in the housing market; this explains why individuals at any level of the economic ladder or more likely to find economic opportunity in cities.

# Chap3: Cities, Sustainability, and Resilience
sustainability: as the aspiration that human activity be made compatible with the long-term health and safety of the natural environment, which would ensure the longevity of our own species (about running towards people, not away from them)

reducing our carbon footprint matters only if extended over large swaths of our population

pg 80 population density and energy consumption in select metro

urbanites share transportation and land in close proximity, they use far fewer resources per person and destroy far less wilderness
they can also take advantge of all the shared services that cities offer (playgrounds, public parks, waterfronts) which use less irrgation and consume less energy to maintain.

americas desest cities (not houses scattered in the woods) produce the lowest greenhouse-gas emissions per capita

since urbanites are green without trying, sustainability can be achieved in cities without new products, technologies or sacrifices.

"There's something even more precious to be gained if we do the right thing. The climate crisis also offers us the chance to experience what very few generations in history have had the privilege of knowing: a generational mission; the exhilaration of compelling moral purpose; a shared and unifying cause; the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict taht so often stifle the restless human need for trascendence; the opportunity to rise."
