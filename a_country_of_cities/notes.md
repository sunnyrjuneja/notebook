"It has been said that if you wish to look far into the future, then you should first look far back in time."

1/2 world pop lives in towns or cities

top 6 cities are there
pacific rim fastest growing region in next 5 years

industralized socities: buildings and transport of people and goods account for 70% of total energy expended
urbanization offers economies of scale
manhattan resident vs detriot (comparable climates)
< 1/5 gasoline
< 1/3 electricity
usa data: economic growth & job creation are stronger in cities, poverty rising faster in suburbs
higher gas prices, foreclosure rates in suburban

# Chap1: A County of Countries: Of Highways, Houses and Hedges
Land development has quadrupled since 1945, 2x the rate of population growth
11m americans hold mortgages with greater values than their homes

Big Idea: 
Our most urgent problems (may they be economic, socioeconomic, public health, environmental problem) are all exacerbated or driven by how we live. Policies at all levels of gov (federal, state, municipal) drive suburbanization.

"City": place that can provide significant ridership for mass transit such as a subway network (30 =< housing units per acre) [an acre is about the size of a football field].
City <-> Hyperdensity (used interchangably)
transit based criteria essential since big cities (vs real) create slightly more compact places where driving is still essential
book contrasts itself against other urban literature by using transit based density instead of any other density measure
results in a city which is neither walkable nor drivable

Big Idea:
Suburbanization Driven by a set of political and historical circumstances

1934: FDR new deal policy of National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Admistration and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Coproration to stem the tide of foreclosures resulting from the great depression and to make housing and mortgages more affordable. More people could afford down payments and interest on mortgages and the market for SFhs became much larger.

1940s: National City Lines Cartel (General Motors, Firestone and Standard Oil)
elimination of electric streetcar routes across the country

Post WW2:  Federal Highway Act of 1956 and intense lobbying by NAR further enabled home ownership through expansion of roadways into, out of and between cities resulting in impossible level of suburban development.

1950s-1970s: Recession, racial tension and fear of nuclear war lead to the dispersement of population from cities to suburbs. Cities collected less taxes which lead to smaller municipal budgets, high debt, and increased crime. In general, this became a time of high anti-urban sentiment.

2012 WSJ : Cities are growing faster than their urban counter parts
2013 MNSBC: Economy slump (temp), inability of young people to afford downpayments (temp), and a preference for places that do not require driving everywhere (perm).

Required to encourage urbanization (and not suburbanization):
* Phasing out federal home mortgage interest deduction (MID)
* ceasing the backing by fannie mae and freddie mac of larger mortgages
* removing subsidies for the oil industry
* reclassifying SUVs and minivans as light trucks
* Allocating federal transportation dollars by population
* distributing those dollars fairly across all modes of transportation, rail, mass transit, insead of disporportionately funding highways and runways
* streamlining the national environmental protection act (NEPA) to reduce the redtape associated with urban development and building large scale infastructure
* pricing fuel to reflect negative externalities (pollution and congestion)
